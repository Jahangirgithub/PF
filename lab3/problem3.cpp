/*Problem 3:

Write a function that accepts an integer parameter denoting a monthâ€™s number (between 1 and 12) and returns the number of days in the that month.


Use the following criteria to identify leap years: 
Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 400. 
For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not. 
If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and if only it is divisible by 4. 
For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not. 

Write a program that asks the user to enter the month (letting the user enter an integer in the range of 1 through 12) and the year. The program should then display the number of days in that month. 


For Example:
 
Enter a month (1-12): 2 [Enter] 
Enter a year: 2008 [Enter] 
29 days
