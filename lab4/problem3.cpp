/*
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of seconds. Your program shall have a user defined function that does all calculations and returns the appropriate value. 
 There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 60, the program should display the number of minutes and seconds in that many seconds. 
 There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 3,600, the program should display the number of hours, minutes and seconds in that many seconds. 
 There are 86,400 seconds in a day. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 86,400, the program should display the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds in that many seconds

For example, 
. user enters 80:	the program shall output “80 seconds = 1 minute and 20 seconds”
. User enters 3700:	the program shall output “3700 seconds = 1 Hour, 1 Minute and 40 seconds”
. User enters 87000:	the program shall output “87000 seconds = 1 Day and 10 Minutes ”
. User enters 90000:	the program shall output “87000 seconds = 1 Day and 1 Hour ”
