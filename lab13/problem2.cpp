/*
Write a program that declares and defines a one dimensional dynamic array of integers A of size as mentioned by the user during input. Then declare a dynamic array of pointers B of the same size as A. Make the cells of array B point to the respective cells of array A. That is, B[0] points to the memory location represented by A[0], B[1] points at A[1] and so on.
