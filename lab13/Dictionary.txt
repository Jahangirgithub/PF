Aaanerating random s can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random  will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the  as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random  somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random  be the ending  in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the  into their writing.
